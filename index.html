      <h1>Welcome to Brandon's Knife Sharpening</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Brandon Haug, and I’ve been sharpening knives for over a decade.
        Whether you’re a home cook, a culinary professional, an outdoor
        enthusiast, or maybe even a serial killer (no judgment), my goal is to
        keep your knives performing at their absolute best. A dull knife isn’t
        just annoying—it’s dangerous, increasing the risk of slips and
        unpredictable cuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based in Wofford Heights, I proudly serve the surrounding areas,
        including Kernville, Lake Isabella, and Bodfish. Over the years, I’ve
        worked with everything from everyday kitchen knives to specialty hunting
        and fillet blades, perfecting my technique to ensure each knife reaches
        its full cutting potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        My sharpening process combines traditional whetstone techniques with
        modern fixed-angle systems, blending precision with efficiency. I also
        recommend my proprietary engineered microbevel edge—a method that
        modifies the primary bevel to a shallower angle while adding a steeper
        microbevel. This unique geometry creates a sharper, more durable edge
        that retains its cutting power longer than conventional sharpening
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>

        proper knife care, check out the
