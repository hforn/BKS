        <h2>Key Sharpening Terms</h2>
        <p>
          Before diving into sharpening techniques, it's helpful to understand
          these key terms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Grit</strong>: The coarseness or fineness of the sharpening
            medium. Lower grits remove metal quickly, while higher grits polish
            the edge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Angle</strong>: The degree at which a blade is sharpened.
            Most outdoor bushcraft/hunting knives are sharpened at 25-30°.
            Standard kitchen knives are between 18-22°, while Japanese knives
            can be as low as 10-15°.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Apex</strong>: The very tip of the cutting edge where both
            beveled surfaces meet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Burr</strong>: A small, raised flap of metal that forms
            along the apex during sharpening.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Microbevel</strong>: A fine secondary bevel at the apex that
            significantly increases durability and edge retention without
            sacrificing sharpness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scratch Pattern</strong>: The direction and size of the
            marks left by the sharpening medium.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Edge-Leading</strong>: A sharpening technique where the edge
            moves toward the sharpening medium (as if slicing into it). This
            produces a strong, clean edge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Edge-Trailing</strong>: A technique where the edge moves
            away from the sharpening surface (as if dragging the blade). Often
            used with belt sharpeners but can leave a weaker, burr-heavy edge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lapping</strong>: A precision polishing technique that
            sharpens the apex without rounding it, achieving ultra-high grit
            finishes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stropping</strong>: The final polishing of the edge, usually
            done with leather and fine abrasives to refine sharpness and remove
            any remaining imperfections.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Makes a Knife Dull?</h2>
        <p>
          A knife becomes dull when its cutting edge wears down, rolls over, or
          sustains damage. This can happen through repeated use, improper
          cutting techniques, poor cutting surfaces, or lack of maintenance. A
          dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one because it requires more
          force, increasing the risk of slipping and injury.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rolling Apex</strong>: The edge folds over due to impact
            with hard surfaces, especially with a weaker apex.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chipping</strong>: Small pieces break off the edge, common
            in harder steels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Abrasion</strong>: The edge gradually wears down through
            repeated contact with cutting surfaces.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sharpening Methods & Their Pros/Cons</h2>
        <h3>Freehand Whetstone Sharpening</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Precise control, best for high-quality edges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Requires significant skill, no precision
          repeatability.
        </p>

        <h3>Electric Sharpeners</h3>
        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Quick and easy.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Can remove too much metal, creates a weak
          concave edge, and cannot microbevel.
        </p>

        <h3>Pull-Through Sharpeners</h3>
        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Convenient, inexpensive.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Aggressive on the edge, reduces blade life,
          excessive material removal, weak edge prone to chipping and dulling
          due to horizontal scratch patterns, and cannot microbevel.
        </p>

        <h3>Belt Sharpeners</h3>
        <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Fast and effective.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Edge-trailing causes burr formation and risks
          compromising steel tempering.
        </p>

        <h3>Fixed-Angle Edge-Leading Whetstone Sharpening</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Pros:</strong> Highest quality results, minimal metal removal,
          and precise repeatability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cons:</strong> Time-consuming compared to pull-through or belt
          sharpeners.
        </p>

        <h2>Engineered Apex &amp; Microbevel Angles</h2>
        <p>
          An engineered apex ensures a refined, consistent cutting edge. Adding
          a microbevel—a secondary bevel at a slightly higher angle—improves
          durability without reducing sharpness. For example, a knife sharpened
          at 15° on its primary bevel may have a 28° microbevel, balancing
          sharpness with edge retention.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Knife Care Tips</h2>
        <p>
          Keeping a knife sharp depends on more than just sharpening. Proper
          knife care is essential for maintaining a sharp edge as long as
          possible.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Use the Right Cutting Board</strong>: End-grain wooden
            cutting boards are best. Plastic cutting boards are a close second,
            though they are susceptible to depositing microplastics into your
            food. Avoid glass, stone, ceramic, or even bamboo surfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proper Rocking Technique</strong>: When chopping using the
            rocking technique, avoid applying excessive force on the spine when
            rotating the knife between cuts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proper Scraping Technique</strong>: When scraping food off
            the cutting board, use a bench scraper or the spine of the knife,
            not the edge.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cleaning</strong>: It is best to hand wash and dry
            immediately. Avoid dishwashers, as harsh or abrasive detergents can
            lead to corrosion or dulling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Storage</strong>: Store knives in a wooden block, on a
            magnetic strip, or with blade guards to prevent damage. Avoid
            storing knives loosely in a drawer where they can knock against
            other utensils or in hard-material knife blocks like marble, glass,
            or steel.
          </li>
        </ul>
